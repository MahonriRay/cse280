# Graphs  

## Undirected Graph  
Vertices = {A, B, C}  
Edges = {(A,B), (B,A),(B,C),(C,B),(A,C),(C,A)} 

## Directed Graph  
V = {A, B, C}
E = {(A, B), (B, C), (A, C)}  

f: E -> V x V  
E $\subseteq$ V x V  

Adjacency Table  
A: [B,C]  
B: [A,C,E]  
C: [A,B,D]  
D: [C,E]  
E: [B,D]  

Total Degree: 12  

## Complete Graph  
Edge between every pair of vertices.  

## Isomorphism  
If there is a mapping between vertuces & Edges of the 2 graphs.  
1. Same number of vrtices  
2. Same number of edges.  
3. Degree sequence of the vertices is the same.  

## Traversing Graphs  
Walk - Sequence of edges between vertices  
Len(walk) - # of edges  
Open walk - Start/stop on different vertices  
Closed walk - Start/stop on same vertices  
Circuit - Closed walk without duplicate edges  
Cycle - Citcuit without duplicated vertices  
Euler Circuit - Circuit that visits all do the edges.
