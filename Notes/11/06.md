# Sequence   

A sequence is a function with a domain consisting of a set of consecutive integers(Index)  

### Arithmetic  
Next term defined by the sum of the previous term + a common differentiator  
d = common difference  
an+(d(n-1)(n))/2

### Geometric  
Next term defined by the product of the previous term + a common ratio.  
r = common ratio  
(a(r^n-1)/r-1) r $\neq$ 1  

### Generic Sequence  
$\sum$ f(i) = f(x) + f(x+1) + f(x+2) + f(x+3)  

### Recurrence Relation Requirements  
Requires that a term in the sequence is based the previous term...  

Arithmetic  
1st term = a  
common diff = d  

fn = fn-1 + d - Recurrence Case  
f0 = a - Base Case  

1,3,5,7

Geometric  
1st term = a  
common ratio = r 

fn = r * fn-1  n > 0  
f0 = 5

5,15,45,135  

Generic - Fibonacci  
1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...  

fn = fn-1 + fn-2  
f0 = 1  
f1 = 1
